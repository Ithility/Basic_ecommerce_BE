The modified code extends the application to include features like user profiles, shipping addresses, and order management. 
It introduces new database models such as `ShippingAddress`, `Order`, and `OrderItem` to support these functionalities. 
Routes for user profile management, shipping address handling, and order retrieval are implemented alongside enhancements to cart management, 
including updating and removing items. 
Despite significant expansion, security measures like bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token generation remain integral to the 
application's architecture.
